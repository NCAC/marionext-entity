# marionext-entity

[Marionette.js](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette) uses the __entity__ (Model & Collection) from [backbone](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone).

For [marionext](https://github.com/NCAC/marionext-v1) I looked for a better version, and written in Typescript.

## credit
I have been lucky to find the [model-layer](https://github.com/eprincev-egor/model-layer) project, that met all my expectations :
- written in typescript
- typed DataTypes

To be honest,
__98% of the code is just an adaptation/rewrite from [model-layer](https://github.com/eprincev-egor/model-layer)__
